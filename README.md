## ðŸ“± Responsiveness Note

While the application is **fully functional and visually appealing on desktop**, some views may **not display perfectly on mobile devices** due to layout constraints and time limitations during development.

The app was primarily designed with desktop users in mind, as the main use case involves activity planning, profile setup, and real-time chatting â€” all of which are typically easier to manage on larger screens. Mobile responsiveness was considered, and common breakpoints were addressed, but fine-tuning for all mobile layouts is still a work in progress.

Future improvements will focus on enhancing mobile responsiveness for an optimal experience across all devices.
